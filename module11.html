	<p>The scrum activity turned out to be a useful one, at least for my group member, Lindsey. For me almost all of the coding was pretty much done and I didn’t have much to ask about it in this activity. However, I wanted to receive critique, comments and suggestions about my portfolio. Also, I mentioned the problem with search: the search on site didn’t work because Google didn’t see my portfolio at all.</p>

	<p>Lindsey didn’t find any major mistakes in my portfolio and noticed that everything “works well.” However, she brought my attention to some minor details, like mistakes that might appear in the text on pages. I think that I shall double-check the text that I’ll be adding in the future.</p>

	<p>Lindsey had an issue with navigation. She didn’t know how exactly to create a link from page to page. I’ve already gone through that, so it wasn’t hard to explain it to her. Also, we have discussed which application is more convenient for coding.</p>

	<p>Workshops were extremely effective for me. I didn’t make any specific plans for my workshops and just decided to have as much work to be done as I was able to do. I appeared to be extremely effective; I started building the code for my portfolio step by step. In two days the foundation for my portfolio was finished. It contained the header, which consists of my logo and navigation bar, contact information in the body, footer and background.</p>

	<p>All that remained for me to do by that moment was to fill in the portfolio with text and to solve the problem with search. It caused me many troubles because I couldn’t understand why exactly Google didn’t see my site. The solution appeared to be easy: I just had to add my site to the Google index and after that everything worked just fine. However, the portfolio is still unfinished because it is mostly blank so far. And that is what I am working on right now by maintaining the text for my portfolio.</p>

	<p>During the creation of my portfolio I got stuck with my code a number of times because I didn’t know how to realize something. If the problem was simply because of me forgetting a tag I used to go to HtmlBook.ru and found out everything that I wanted to know about that tag. HtmlBook.ru is a Russian web site that contains a database with all HTML tags and their descriptions. If the problem was in realization, for example, if I couldn’t create an object in a way that I wanted to, then I tried to think about different ways of doing so. It helped me each time except for the search bar but I already described it previously.</p>
